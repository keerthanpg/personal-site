This is a lesson on social-psychology: how different factors come together to cause an epidemic, be it Baltimore's Syphilis, Coke's successful marketing campaign or the American Revolution. Personally, it introduced to me, for the first time, the 80-20 rule(and valuing employees), the connector-maven-salesman factor and the fact that 'coke' is the second most popular word in the world after'okay'.
Definitely a good read. But Gladwell is no statistician or psychologist, hence don't forget the pinch of salt!
