This is a wonderful book! It gives an insider's view of how it feels to run a startup and decide between conflicting options. It makes even more sense if you've already run a startup to be able to understand the nuances and the significance of these choices and their context. From hiring for greatness than lack of weakness, networking to spot the PR managers that can turn chicken shit to chicken salad, from management debt to managing profanity in company culture, this book explores a number of pain points. Essentially, building a company is about building a great product and building the right culture.
Must read if you're planning to start a company or are in the midst of it :)
