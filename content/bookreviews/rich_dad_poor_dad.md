The book starts very promising seeking to counter conventional wisdom of money and investing, and presents quite a few motivational and creative ideas. However, the tone soon turns condescending where the author markets his style of investment, and lashes out at everyone and everything who does otherwise. As Keely here noted, it merely suggests what to do and intimidates the reader about the pitfalls of not doing, but the leaves the reader the figure out the logistics of 'how to do to'.
All in all, I would say the book is motivating, but sports a narrow perspective.
