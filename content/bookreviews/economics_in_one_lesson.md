This was an okay read. The author often advocates policies without enough justifications, and which can be proved as ineffective assuming the Keynesian theory. It is replete with comparisons between a good economist and a bad economist, instructing on their generic personal traits(eg attention to detail) than how they'd decide/act in specific circumstances.
