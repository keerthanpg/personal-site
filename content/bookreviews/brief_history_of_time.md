Frankly, the book began quite promisingly and renders the reader hopes of understanding the origin of the universe. As the book proceeded, it became difficult to comprehend and finally ended with concepts like imaginary time and virtual histories all of which no makes no sense to the unassuming reader. However,it is commendable that Hawkings could put to words all of this without letting the reader taste the complicated math. He has put in a massive effort to break down things, yes, and the conclusions, observations and reasoning is appreciable.
A fair read.
