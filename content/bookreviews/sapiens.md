**spoiler alert** This is an engaging book that briefly touches on the major milestones in the evolution of human beings from the ancient paleolithic period, our sustenance alongside Denisovans and Neanderthals, ancient civilisations to the free market ideology and genetic engineering of today. The author shares a number of wonderful insights to explain why certain events panned out that led to certain characteristics. Some struck home with me. For example, that human babies are born with premature brains since our evolution to being bipedal and change in the female pelvic structure, and how that influenced mating selection and the societal structures of today. At another instance, he explains how imagined realities such as financial instruments, nations and religions are necessary for humans to cooperate on a large scale.

A solid read, highly recommended.
