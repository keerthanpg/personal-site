Option B is a book that advises on countering adverse situations routed in Sheryl Sandberg's autobiographical account. What makes an adverse experience worse is 3Ps: personalisation(that you're to blame), permanence(that it'll last forever) and pervasiveness(that it affects other areas of life) and one should strive to overcome these thought patterns to build resilience. It also talks about how to deal with people who've recently encountered an adversity. This book is less research and more autobiography than Lean In.
