Since I am from India, I found the book interesting only up until the point Obama became president. Until that event, the book describes in erudite passion Obama's youth and his journey to the presidency. His conviction is admirable and his courage/confidence is worth envying. What struck me most was his sense of idealism and how much he stood by it over the years even if others were weary. This idealism, eventually became his vision and his campaign call for presidency. Post the presidency, the book goes into great detail on a multitude of characters in American politics and deep introspection over domestic issues which I didn't find interesting as a non-American.
