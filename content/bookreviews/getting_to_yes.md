This is a book on negotiation that talks about power, ethics, tactics and counter moves in negotiation. It is more about getting what you deserve than gaining more than your fair share. It makes sense to separate the people from the problem, focus on interests over positions, evaluate your alternatives and make the pie bigger for everyone. What I loved the most was the section on common negotiation tactics and how to identify and respond to them. The examples the authors use to explain concepts involve very suave conversations and retorts, which we can do well to adopt in everyday life. The book also examines the softer sides of a negotiation, discussing mutual relationships, conscience, satisfaction among other things.
