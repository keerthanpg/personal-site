Totally worth the three hours!

This is an insider's perspective of Iran's cultural revolution, when their civilisation took a reverse journey amidst war and political instability. Chilling at times, and touching at others. What endeared this book to me is the female narrative, the innocence of her childhood and the courage to confess failures. Here's the story of a little girl who aspired to grow up to be a prophet and forced to confirm into a society of captivated females. Introspective, while unsuspectingly so.
