This is a brief introduction to public policy in India. It discusses formulation, analysis and implementation/revision of policy interventions in the Indian context and uses case studies to investigate into examples of good and bad policy implemented in India. A key learning has been about mathematical models used to collect evidence for policy intervention, such as RCTs and difference-in-difference. Examples that took me by surprise were that of the Balika Cycle Yojana in Bihar and mandating of Aadhar for MGNREGS and pensions in Andhra Pradesh. Do read to find out. :)
