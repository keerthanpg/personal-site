Most of us credit ourselves for being rational individuals and strive for logical consistency in things we do. If you are one, it might be a good idea to read this book and learn the edges of our reasoning. This book will make you question your honesty, your gullibility and your independence of thought. It'll astound you how often we base decisions on seemingly insignificant factors, such as the appearance of a candidate. It'll astound you to the extent your experiences are enhanced by the hype associated with the product. This book will caution you about your irrationality, don't fall for 'FREE!' or that insidious ad. Learn why we instinctively excuse ourselves for mistakes while pin it to character when perpetrated by another, discover the anchoring effect and be a better negotiator, manipulate the utilities of comparison and look sexier among your friends...

Totally a worthwhile read, being a very short book
