This book is an account of several trials done across India and Africa tied into a larger narrative in an attempt to understand the mindset of poor and what causes poverty. It talks about what incentives and circumstances around schemes make a difference in outcomes among the poor. It also explores what priorities and biases affect their decision making when it comes to spending and credit, health care, education and entrepreneurship. This is an extremely well researched and informative read for anybody who cares about solving global poverty.
