This is a very short book, quite a ramble though. The language is very vernacular, often plain and non-creative. It is slightly irritating at first, all the unnecessary emphasis, but one gets used to it.

I don't see why this book is a symbol of teenage rebellion, or why people like the protagonist at all. He generalizes a lot, blames a multitude of external factors for his circumstances and hates and stereotypes almost every other character. He also second guesses himself quite a bit.

Nevertheless, after a while, one falls for his rambling thoughts, often not on point, but vividly descriptive and indicating a sort of free-will of teenagers. It is interesting how he notices and remarks on the most non-quintessential attributes of other characters.
