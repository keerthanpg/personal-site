### Rating 2/5

This book was written more than 40 years ago and is textbook MBA material. Porters five forces analysis is a useful tool in any case study paradigm.  Most of the book reads like common sense to me probably because much of its content has percolated into popular knowledge over the decades since it was written. I also think that its content has not particular suitable to address current tech industries where most of the wealth in the world is created today. It emphasizes a lot on traditional industries and old school business (read MBA) strategies. Best listened to over audio due to low information density. Or better yet, read a tutorial on Porters five forces analysis and skip the book altogether.
