Collection of essays about black holes, quantum mechanics and unified theory that is mostly easy to follow. Hawkings also extrapolates on concepts such as imaginary time, that were controversial parts of 'A Brief History of Time'. The beginning few essays, of his childhood and his fight with ALS, are quite forthcoming and transparent in narrative. The snarky humor at times is an entertaining surprise. It's a short book with lots to learn and it glued me to my seat for two days.
