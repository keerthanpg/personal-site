This book is an account of Yalom's selected cases as a psychoanalyst. It'll impart confidence to your own analysis of human nature and behaviours, and offer to enrich them with the practices and wisdom of an academic insider. What I found most surprising was dream interpretation. While I've always found dreams as abstract representations of everyday randomness, it was astonishing to realise that dreams are a clinically established means to investigate what troubles the mind.
