The Science of Positivity talks about five hormones and neurotransmitters: serotonin, oxytocin, dopamine, endorphin and cortisol and how they affect our everyday behaviour and rationality. The book draws parallels between human brain and an early mammal brain when it comes to decision making. As for me, it helped me be more conscious of negative thought patterns and make an active effort to be more positive.
