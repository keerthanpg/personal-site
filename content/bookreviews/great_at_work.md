This is a fairly useful book. I picked it up as I started my first job to be able to get better on managing work. Most insights from the book are derived from a fairly generalised and large survey of workers in the United States. These derivations are also quite practical to be put to use in daily life and helps you anticipate outcomes of organisational decisions and decide how to participate.

One of my favourite parts of the book was about collaboration: who stands to gain in a collaboration and therefore whether you should take part or not, how to measure a collaboration: by goals, not activities, that collaboration for the sake of collaboration is useless. Another lesson I liked was "Do less, then obsess". It emphasised on the 80-20 rule, on identifying and accomplishing work that is most rewarding, and cutting out waste by focusing. A great read for anyone at their first job!
