This is a must read that emphasises on connecting with people. The author has discussed several strategies that help one to reach out farther in everyday life. While it helps to know important people, this book treats people as means rather than ends in themselves. By the author's logic, one can put a numeric value to relationships with different people based on their influence and stature, and that is a very unromantic and utilitarian world that treats relationships as transactional and one-dimensional to an extent. I think we should all try out the methods he talks about, and throw dinner parties and reach out during conferences and flights, but not for the reasons he mentions. Because people lead interesting lives as curious and complex as ours who can open up new experiences and new knowledge, and are more than a tool to boost your career.

All in all, good read, great guidebook on how to connect, but take it with a grain of salt.
