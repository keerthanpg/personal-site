Ingredients:

1. Blueberries(fresh/dried):150g
2. Pancake mix: 2/3 cup
3. Water: 1/2 cup
4. Sugar/sugar syrup: 1.5tsp/1.5 tbsp
5. Butter: 1 tsp (optional)
6. Cream cheese: 0.5 tsp (optional)

Procedure:

1. Mash the blueberries such that there still are small lumps.
2. Add the flour, water and sugar and mix thoroughly to remove flour lumps.
3. Regulate water to alter consistency. Stop when it looks like dosa batter.
4. Heat flat bottom pan. Add a bit of butter if the pan is not non-stick.
5. Simply pour the batter on pan and rotate the pan until it spreads to the required size, using approximately 1/4 cup batter for each pancake.
6. Cook in medium flame, flip when bottom is brown.
7. Serve with butter/cream cheese and/or maple syrup.

Tips:

1. Add butter to batter to increase calorie content.
2. Serve with fruit. :)
