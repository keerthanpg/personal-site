Tied up angel, wings battered  
Shackled by the ankles  
I lay rotting in the dirt  
Among worms and spiders  
Helpless and desolate  
Like a forgotten ghost in the ceiling

But then I mustered my will,  
Chewed up the chains  
And through the broken attic window  
I climbed  
Cut my wings on the glass  
Yet jumped into the moonlight  
And took flight into an unknown  
With broken chains on my ankles  
Leaving the darkness behind  
To a place worthy of me

I flew and flew, alone  
Scared of falling to fatigue  
Yet determined to not return  
Wounded and bleeding and parched  
Longing to see a bloody red daybreak  
At last  
With sweaty palms I waited  
For the rays of the sun to balm my tired limbs  
Suddenly the light hit my pupils  
And my eyes, used to darkness, flinched

The warmth engulfed me  
Spreading over my body  
Closing my open wounds  
My wings mended in a translucent glow  
My parched skin now healed  
I let go of the pain in my heart

And I took flight  
In one fell swoop  
Into the sun and the blinding light  
Breathing in freedom  
To a dawn of hope and pride  
I broke free and I rose  
I rose and I rose
