It’s going to be okay \
It’s going to be okay because I will make it so 

I have cut chords with people who didn’t care\
I have moved on and I am okay \
I can do it a million more times \
And still be okay \
Why just okay? I will thrive. 

I have said so many good byes \
I have lost both people, money and places \
I am still okay, I am happy even. \
I have cried and bawled my eyes out \
I have been frustrated enough to pull hair out \
But the sun still goes up and with it I go up \
I’ll be okay.

Whatever tornado hits the world \
And displaces everything that is familiar \
The ocean in my heart is deep \
Calm, peaceful and familiar. \
I am the only stable that needs to be. \
My heart can take infinite damage \
And still survive \
Like the sword of Griffindor, \
Absorbing what makes one stronger 

My resolve is immovable, my principles uncracked \
Even if I fall my conscience is unsullied \
My fist is iron and autocratic, my will irreversible \
My pride intact , my morals unshaken \
My voice is familiar and soothing \
No matter the change, \
Even in the eye of my storm, \
I am the only constant that needs to be

Like goddess Lakshmi that sits on lotuses \
Growing amidst the dirt while rising above it all \
Untainted \
Powerful while feminine and beautiful \
My freedom is absolute, \
My autonomy over my body sacrosanct and untouched \
Wounds are laid and scars are healed, so many times \
I become unbroken and whole \
Over and over again

No matter how many times it is doused \
The fire in my heart will never be quenched \
No matter how many times I fail \
I will never be defeated..
