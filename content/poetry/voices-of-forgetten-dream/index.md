Third somebody in the room  
Like an impenetrable wall  
Between us.  
The mind knits careful words  
yearns for a soft feel of the cheeks  
pinches in anticipation of the kiss.  
Unsaid, undone.  
Cheesy sugary eternals  
Aborted, replaced with blank expressions  
All the love means nothing  
With a strange face in the room  
Not intimate, never alone..  
Not two, always three.  
Cackling laughter that fills the room  
Empty persuasions to reassure  
Empty, meaningless lies  
Meant to fulfill a need  
Violating touch leaves you small  
As the strange face grows larger than life  
Looking over you, invading mind spaces  
Forever changed  
Promises failed  
Transformed irreparably  
Two souls emerged disentangled,  
As they grew stranger and colder  
Repressed ideals, only fools are dreamy  
Warm shining enduring star  
Put out by a tsunami of betrayal  
Unfeeling, cold, how much we’ve changed  
What a spectacle it could’ve been  
Binary stars, touring cosmic space  
For eternity, spinning in a consuming trance  
Soulful sync  
Leading to growing, interesting worlds  
New life, new worlds, new traditions, new memories  
What a spectacle!  
Old timid couple  
Bent spines, white hair  
Sagging skin hand in wrinkly palms  
70 mighty years behind them  
Accomplished dreams behind them  
Smiling,  
Gazing into six foot pits  
Beds for sleep  
Side by side  
Alas for the starry flares years ago  
Burnt in discord  
Disrupted, spinning in turbulant feelings  
The string that connects hearts  
going aroud the globe  
snapped,  
hurt  
A thousand yellow stroked plumerias,  
Fell at once  
Torn,  
Buried, melting into soil  
Separated in search for cosmic purpose  
Together no more,  
Partners no more  
Familiar no more  
Stars have no memories  
Pieces of stone that they are  
Some could love you more in a year  
Than others in fifty  
But why bother  
Why preserve  
Tainted, scratched pots  
Broken scattered pieces  
Blend into soil  
To be moulded again  
In hope of a new story, new journey, new life  
Mud has no memory  
But in an elusive strange dream  
Immersed in the fragrance of fallen plumerias  
On winding dew-wet roads  
And walks at dawn  
Spotting owls from cycle rears  
Magical happy dream  
Someone unusual  
Seems strangely familiar..
