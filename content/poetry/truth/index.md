The truth is absolute and immutable. \
The beauty of physics and our world is that \
The truth is traveling at the speed of the light cone, \
Sights and scenes of exactly what happened and was said \
Scattering from one end of the universe to the other \
Never to be muted \
Perennially out there to be seen for those that want to see 

The truth remains true \
Regardless of whether one hundred or one million believes \
The truth remains true \
Regardless of whether no one believes \
It doesn’t become more or less true as a function of the size \
or the power of the set of believers \
The truth doesn’t care about your modeling of belief functions 

The way that the photons of truth are scattered, you are bathed in it \
Your whole life, believing or not, plays out on a stage engulfed by it 

When one is heavy with important truth \
That would light someone in darkness \
That is costly to be kept guarded \
One would shout it from the rooftops, \
from the mountains and the radio stations \
One would send it racing through the universe 

To move fearlessly, to move gracefully, \
To break what needs to be broken \
And what will not withstand the truth being spoken
