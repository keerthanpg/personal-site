Summer in my backyard \
Warm coffee in my belly \
The sun simmers on my chest \
Filling my bosom with love 

The sun smiles at me from afar \
My pug flashes her puppy eyes from my lap \
Newly sprung summer flowers beam from around \
And so I sit in my backyard on a carefree sunday 

The wind hums a sweet little song \
Caressing my wild hair like would a lover \
Guiding falling leaves and pollen my way \
Showering me in natureâ€™s bountiful love letters 

When I close my eyes, I see a pink warm glow \
Craning my neck for the rays falling on my cheeks \
And in the sky I see \
Translucent worms floating among clouds

Snuggling cozily with my pug on my chair \
My mind is feather light, my brain in blissful humdrum \
Counting the blessings in my life, and all this love \
Afloat with gratitude to be alive and right here, right this moment
