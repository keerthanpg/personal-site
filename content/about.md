Hi


I am Keerthana! I am a roboticist at Google Brain: I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to get robots to do everyday tasks with end to end machine learning. I am passionate about building human-level self-improving intelligence in bits and atoms. 

If you don't shut me up, I will talk endlessly about robotics, artificial intelligence and self-driving. Currently much of my free time is spent  authoring a textbook on Machine Learning for Robotics with OReilly Media. I am passionate about investing and stock markets, start-ups and technology, fitness, public policy in India and gender equality. 

I currently live in San Francisco. Among other things, I played chess at the national level as a 10 year old, can speak four languages and successfully petitioned the Indian Supreme Court to change the constitution and legalise alternate sexuality in India. I am the lucky mother of an adorable pug puppy, Kiwi, who is monstrosity and innocence rolled into one. I love to find humor in everyday things, write creepy and unsettling poetry and pace the hallways at night worrying about existential issues.
