Hi


I am Keerthana! I do research at Google Deepmind: I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to get scale robotics and build general purpose intelligence in the physical world. 

The topics where I think I am an expert at are robotics, artificial intelligence and self-driving. I just wrote and published a textbook on "AI for Robotics". I am on the look out for my next side project. 

I currently live in San Francisco. Among other things, I play a ton of speed chess, can speak four languages and I like enjoyng the sun in my backyard. I am the lucky mother of an adorable pug puppy, Kiwi, who is monstrosity and innocence rolled into one. 

I am figuring out my new self everyday :)
