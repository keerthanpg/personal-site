Hi

I am Keerthana! I am a roboticist at Google Brain, so by day I convert coffee into code for training robots to do everyday tasks. I can talk endlessly about artificial intelligence and self-driving.  I am also passionate about investing and stock markets, start-ups and technology, fitness, public policy in India and gender equality. 


A part of my day is spent playing with my pug puppy Kiwi, who is monstrosity and innocence rolled into one. I live in San Francisco and in my free time love to read, write, work out, ski, photograph and play board games. Other life skills include laughing at my own jokes, writing creepy and unsettling poetry and wondering about existential issues.
