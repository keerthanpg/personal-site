I have a happy orchid plant\
One that blooms white with a purple hue\
Standing against my window nonchalant\
Shining against the sun effortless

And then one day I decided to move\
My happy orchid sat in a box\
Waiting to see the light\
But for a while it was left forgotten

In the darkness, while I sorted my affairs\
It stood biding its wait\
As dust settled on its glossy green leaves\
Turning them a shackled shade of brown

Then one day I took my happy plant out to the sun\
But lo, along fell its wilted flowers\
Dried as though from a deep sorrow\
Crumpled as if from age and fatigue

I still kept the plant on my countertop\
Lamenting its languished flowers\
Barren in a dusty charm\
It stood biding its wait again

I never stopped watering\
Seeking hope like an oasis in a desert\
I gently wiped the dusty leaves and\
Picked away the last drooping flower

Leaving behind what’s dead and long gone\
Decidedly I accepted the present\
Thus many days went by\
And the sun smiled and set upon us aplenty

But one day, just as I had forgotten\
A little bud sprung up on the stalk\
Like all but one acne\
On a pretty woman’s flawless face

And then another and another\
Soon, my happy orchid was just as alive again, even more,\
All the watering triumphed over hopelessness\
And happiness was knocking at my door again

As though happiness was waiting for me\
To walk from an unserving present\
Just one hard decision away\
And I only need say yes

New doors open where others close\
Like little buds overwhelming an orchid stem\
That drooping flowers once clung from\
My happiness, that I so fiercely fought for\
That I’m determined to protect at every cost\
Compounds to abundance from undiscovered prospects\
Like relentlessly blooming beautiful flowers\
On my beaming orchid plant in the sun.
