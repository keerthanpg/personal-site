Normal waves  
Dampened by the sinking weights  
of hurt over years  
Unflinching today  
Unmoved  
Blanks eyes, and quizzical brows  
Witness doubtful cries  
Numb is the word  
To what I feel  
A game of rock, paper, scissors  
Defeated are those who show their guts  
Feeling small  
Laying it out there  
Bare, to be trampled on  
To be a display  
On the sidewalks of an uncaring passerby  
Screams fall on deaf ears  
Like long nails screeching on glass  
Muffled by the shower  
Who cares  
Numb is the word  
To what I feel  
The wall is unsurmountable  
The wall canâ€™t be broken  
The wall, is willful  
The wall of deceit
