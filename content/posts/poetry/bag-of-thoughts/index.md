# Bag of Thoughts

A bag of thoughts we are  
a tiny little star  
sweltering pot  
a burning core at its heart  
likes and dislikes  
ambitions and idiosyncracies  
philosophies, glued together  
in a weak concoction of will  
A sphere of influence around  
we hold close ones  
As we journey through space,  
carrying our identities  
our baggage  
in a journey called life  
People come by, simering plasma like us,  
held together by their will  
Some graze by,  
some hit the core and are shattered away  
some spin off near the tangent  
some fear to get close  
watching from a distance  
our burning embers  
but some do  
some do stay with us all along  
within the sphere of influence around  
sharing their warmth  
tolerating our tidbits  
and we see the world together  
as we pass by  
boiling together  
sharing ideologies  
perspectives  
shaping each other  
through memories  
What’s within you  
What’s around you..
