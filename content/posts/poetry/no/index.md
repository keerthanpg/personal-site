No,  
I will not be the decked up doll,  
Meant to please  
Dumbed down by the appropriate amount  
Draped in a tone of sugar and niceness  
Intellect and insanity stuffed down to a small chest  
Thrown into a sea  
Sinking deep in its bellies  
While the silent waves leave no hint  
Of the tempest that rages within  
I refuse to be the calm waves that kiss your feet  
But I will be the storm that jolts you awake, honey  
No, I refuse to be the caged, cut down parrot that picks your luck at cue  
But I will be the eagle that swoons, flying unrestrained far above your world  
No I refuse to be the Lakshmi at your knees  
Because I am the Kali that can pin you down  
No, no  
I refuse.  
I refuse to be your obedient nourisher  
I refuse to listen to you shout running streams of hot tears  
Living on morsels of respect and breadcrumbs of love  
I would rather be the free bird that escaped your clutch  
Your deepest regret that unsettles you forever  
No I will not be the embellishment to your trophies  
I will not be your golden snitch  
A sidelined character in your mediocre tale  
That only serves to plug your wanting insufficiencies  
I will be my own grand epic that is recited for centuries  
and you, a mere shadow in my everwinding storylines  
I refuse to be just nice, I refuse to keep my voice low  
I refuse to dress ‘like the other girls’  
My voice will not be the undertone to your insecurities  
But it will be the trumpet call that moves generations  
I refuse to fit in the little box you hand out  
For I’m born to be a particle wave raging in the vastness of creation  
An everlasting spirit, a relentless force to reckon with!
