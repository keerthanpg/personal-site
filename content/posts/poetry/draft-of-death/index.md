# Draft of death

A storm still raged in the midst of sea,  
Where I had murdered you,  
I lost you, far away  
Your bloodstains mixed in the steam  
Like a whirlpool of red  
But far out in the sea where no one could see  
Your face haunts me  
My hands feeling, forever slippery with your blood  
If I’ve slain, why are you still tied to me  
Like an albatross around my neck

I’m the woman that befriends a storm  
So I took my sails to confront you  
Out in the sea, the red tempest that you’re  
I cusped your slain spirit,  
Like a ball of red glass and slipped in my purse  
You will not haunt me when I lose you in the desert  
So I wandered  
With your murder clenched in my hands  
Concealed like a quizzical spirit

The sandstorms embraced me as one of their own  
But you coloured them red with my guilt, conquering,  
As I threw you into the air  
In a million splints of shattered glass  
You take me by surprise  
But unbeknownst to you,  
I savour the bloody humidity  
Amidst which I walked and walked in the scorching sun  
The heat did not fade you  
Neither did it consume my resolve to lose you  
You made shields of red clouds  
And I hate the roses and sunsets, remembering you.

You taste like a draft of death  
In the blood red of my wine glass  
Your smile dissolving in its feathery swirls  
Swirls, like that of a red sandstorm  
And I quietly relish the sip of you  
While donning a seductive smile  
Catching your playful glance across the room  
Come, baby, let’s dance.
