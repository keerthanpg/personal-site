# Silence

Silence  
Like an ocean that leaps and bounds  
Like a dragon that kicks and breathes fire, alive  
Like a wide chasm between us  
Our hearts are so far, far apart  
Closed to each other  
Though for a second we were so close  
Like a bridge out into happiness  
Like a hand that appears while drowning

But now I’m puzzled  
Standing on a vast mountain range  
Looking into caves very strange  
Brooding beneath an eerie silence that I cannot change  
Trying to make sense of thoughts rather intense  
Why does my heart incense  
The air is heavy, as if with words unsaid  
And all the murmurs are only in my head  
Like a thousands ghosts are haunting  
And a thousand birds are cackling  
But just not yet..  
Like a mighty river held prisoner by a dam  
That only a tiny fracture can let unleash  
My words are tied to silence  
But only a pin drop can break lose all chaos

What is broken in all but a second,  
Is perhaps never meant to last  
Like a dream in broken glass  
Like a mirage that fades as you near  
Why must I fear  
That for an instance you appeared so dear  
And just like that you easily did disappear

Leaving me bruised and in pain  
Like I’m cold out in the rain  
Why did you leave me bereft on this hard terrain  
Only to sting in my memories like an old sprain  
Despite I’m happy to have run into you  
Even though we bid adieu  
I walked from the dark into a warm hue  
To dance with you, and I’m no longer blue
