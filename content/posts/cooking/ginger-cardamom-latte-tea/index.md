Ingredients(makes 2 cups):

1. Water — 1 cup
2. Milk — 1 cup
3. Sugar — based on preference
4. Tea leaves — 2 tsps( I use Red Label brand and the strength of the tea depends on the brand somewhat. Green tea is weak)
5. Ginger — small chunk (approx 2cm _ 2cm _ 0.5cm)
6. Cardamom seeds — 0.5 tsp

Procedure:

1. Cut the ginger chunk into tiny pieces.
2. Heat the water on stove. Add tea, sugar, ginger and cardamom seeds.
3. Let it boil for a minute. Add water to compensate for evaporation loss.
4. Add the milk, wait until the mixture boils and then take it off the stove.
5. Filter and serve!

Pro-tips:

1. Powder the cardamom seeds and mash/convert to paste the ginger chunks to extract flavour better. By powdering, on can cut down on quantity while maintaining the same effect in taste.
2. Adding couple seeds of pepper tastes nice, do not add pepper powder.
3. I generally take lots of sugar with tea/coffee but this works well with little sugar.
