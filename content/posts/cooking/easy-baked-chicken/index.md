What you need:

1. Tender chicken breasts — 0.5 pounds
2. Olive oil — 2 table spoons
3. Ginger garlic paste — 1 table spoon
4. Pepper finely ground — 1 teaspoon
5. Chilly powder — 0.25 teaspoon
6. Garam masala — a pinch
7. Turmeric powder— a pinch
8. Lemon — a small slice
9. Salt — as required

How to:

1. Mix the powders and ginger-garlic to a paste.
2. Cut the breast into 2–4 large slices
3. Rub the olive oil on the meat
4. Now make shallow oblique slits on the surface of the chicken so the masalas and salt can sink in
5. Apply the salt and then the paste earlier prepared evenly. Go thicker on thicker cross sections and scarce on the corners.
6. Preheat oven to 400 F.
7. Place the meat on an oven friendly tray and bake for 10 minutes.
8. Take it out, apply lime juice on both sides.
9. Flip and bake for 12 more minutes until the center is cooked and tender.
10. Serve hot :)
